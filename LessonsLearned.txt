DB Setup/ Curl Script additions/ Scaling Elo in README.txt

Lessons learned:
I have definitely learned (too late) that writting tests is really useful, since it really helped me to find kinks in my Elo calculations 
and made me engage with it on a more thorough basis. I also learned that proper structuring can speed up work considerably after some initial 
time investement and that it is well worth it in the long run, since it was easier than usual to track down problematic sections even a month after 
writting them.
What I value most by far is the feeling of writting purposeful queries.
The stateless nature of the MTCG Server was new territory for me, so I had to learn a lot about receiving and processing incomming payloads and 
how to package a response properly, covering multiple possible exceptions and context sensitive responses.
